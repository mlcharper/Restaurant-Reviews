-HTML5
-CSS3

Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a well-structured, visually distinct website modeled after examples in the course zyBook but 
expanded with personalized content, styling, and local context. It was an opportunity to practice semantic markup, CSS layout design, 
form integration, and overall site architecture.

Notes
This project was submitted as Submission 02 in the course and hosted in a publicly viewable directory. While the review submission 
form is non-functional, it visually mimics the behavior of a live form. The project has been tested in multiple browsers and passed 
HTML5 and CSS3 validation tests.
